Catena: Efficient Non-equivocation via Bitcoin 
==============================================

Catena enables applications to start their own "micro-blockchain" within a blockchain like Bitcoin. Clients running on mobile phones can verify a micro-blockchain _efficiently_ by only downloading tens of megabytes rather than 100 gigabytes of Bitcoin data. Because micro-blockchains are as hard to fork as the Bitcoin blockchain, they enable blockchain-based applications like Blockstack to run _securely_ on small devices like mobile phones or internet-of-things (IoT) devices.
